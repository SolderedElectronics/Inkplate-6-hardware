Open Source Hardware (OSH) files for e-paper display Inkplate 6 can be found in this repo. The files are final, for production version 1.0, finished and built in 2020 for backers, preorders and other early birds. Inkplate 6 is a powerful, Wi-Fi enabled ESP32 based six-inch e-paper display â€“ recycled from a Kindle e-reader. Its main feature is simplicity. Just plug in a USB cable, open Arduino IDE, and change the contents of the screen with few lines of code.
